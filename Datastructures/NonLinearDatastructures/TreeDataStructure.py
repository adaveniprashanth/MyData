'''
A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

Why Tree Data Structure?
  Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack, and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. 
In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size.

Tree Terminologies:
1.Node:
  A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.

2.Edge:
  It is the link between any two nodes.

3.Root:
  It is the topmost node of a tree.
  
4.Height of a Node:
  The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).

5.Depth of a Node:
  The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.

6.Height of a Tree:
  The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.

7.Degree of a Node:
  The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.

8.Forest:
  A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.

3.AVL Tree
4.B-Tree

Tree Traversal:
  In order to perform any operation on a tree, you need to reach to the specific node.
The tree traversal algorithm helps in visiting a required node in the tree.
