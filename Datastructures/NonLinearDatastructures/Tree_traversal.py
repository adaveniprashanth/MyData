# Traversing a tree means visiting every node in the tree.

'''
Linear data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked list have only one way to read the data. 
But a hierarchical data structure like a tree can be traversed in different ways.
'''

'''
Types of traversal:
1.Inorder: (left -> root -> right)
2.Preorder: (root -> left -> right)
3.postorder: (left -> right -> root)
