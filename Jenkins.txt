Jenkins Features:
1. Easy bug detection
2. extensible
3. more plugins
4. Distributed systems support


Jenkins pipeline:
1.developers commit the changes to source(github, perforce)
2.jenkins server builds the build file
3. performes the testing on the build files
4. after passing the test cases it will release the build in environment
5. finally it will deploy the build in production environment

Jenkins architecture:
it has been divided into 2 parts.
1. developer push the code in to github
2. then jenkins pulls the code from source repository and performs the tests and send the report to developers
3. if the testcases passes, then jenkins build the build file using maven server.
4. and filnally run the testcases using maven or selineum.

Master slave architecture:
jenkins master server will fetch the code from source repository and then 
it will distribute its load to all its slaves. master will control the execution of code in its slaves.

Jenkins prerequisites:
1. java JDK 1.7 or 1.8

Jenkins can be installed using normal application(jenkins.msi) or using jenkins.war file (java -jar  <filename>.war)

jenkins root folder:
it is a home folder for jenkins. where it will have all the configurations, workspaces and jobs.

Jenkins dashboard parts:

1.Manage jenkins:
	it will have all the menu option to manage the jenkins application.
	a. configure system: will helps to handle the home directory to store workspace, configurations 
		it will helps to handle the no.of threads to run jenkins i.e. how many jobs have to execute at a time.
		and Email notifications 
	b. global tool configuration: will helps to set the applications which needs to be used to complete the execution on jenkins
	
	c. configure global security: will helps to handle/store the jenkins users details. so it can store these details in its own database or it 
		can be connected to LDAP server.

2.NewItem:
	it will hepls to create a jenkins job for CI(continuous Integration). There you can create a freestyle job, pipeline, multipipeline project and maven project and etc.
	Then selecting any one option you can get the option to control the job i.e. general details, job name,source code management,build triggers,build steps and post build actions etc.

--> We can schedule the build using the option build periodically in build trigger options.
