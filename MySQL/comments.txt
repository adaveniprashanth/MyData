How do you make a phone selfie look like a professional camera operator took it?
Excuse me, folks. Everyone needs to double-tap on this picture ASAP. 
It’s the most beautiful thing you will ever see. 
Live for the moments you cannot put in words. 
I hope we will be best friends until we die. 
Then, we stay ghost pals to take such beautiful pictures. 
Friends come and go, but true buddies stick like that mark on your skin. 
I can survive without a girlfriend. 
But I cannot survive without you as my best friend. 
You are my best buddy, my other half, and my human diary. 
You mean the world to me. I love you. 
I feel like I have known your whole life. 
So you have been this cool since day one? 
I don’t know if you mind knowing this, but my buddy is the cutest guy around. 
You are the superhot thing to have graced this planet since the Yucatan meteorite. 
This picture needs to illustrate the word fun in the dictionary. 
Good times plus crazy friends equal great memories in this picture. 
Frankly, I can never imagine not being in the company of someone amazing like you. 
You will not always be next to me, but be sure that you will have my back always. 
We will always be friends until we are so old and senile. 
You look like a baby with that smile on your face. 
God bless you and continue making me smile like this. 
We will one day be the old ladies causing a lot of trouble in nursing homes. 
The cuteness of your face and innocence of your eyes is just as incredible as our friendship. 
I don’t know what special thing I did to deserve a best friend like you. 
Wow, you are flawless, intelligent, and bright. 
Making you my best friend is the best thing I could have done. 
I think that standing beside you makes you better looking. 
Why wasn’t I invited for the snap then? 
This is a perfect example of a quality portrait of a quality human being. 
You look awesome. 
I couldn’t help but share my thoughts.
