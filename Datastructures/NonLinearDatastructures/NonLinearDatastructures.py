'''
Non linear data structures:
  Unlike linear data structures, elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. 
Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.
'''

# Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data structures.

'''
1. Graph Data Structure:
  In graph data structure, each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges.
Popular Graph Based Data Structures:

a.Spanning Tree and Minimum Spanning Tree
b.Strongly Connected Components
c.Adjacency Matrix
d.Adjacency List

2. Trees Data Structure
  Similar to a graph, a tree is also a collection of vertices and edges. However, in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.
Popular Tree based Data Structure

a.Binary Tree
b.Binary Search Tree
c.AVL Tree
d.B-Tree
e.B+ Tree
f.Red-Black Tree
